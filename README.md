**framework-converter**

(active project)

This web application is designed to simplify the process of converting your existing web applications into different frameworks. By uploading a folder containing your web application, you can effortlessly transform it into the framework of your choice. Our tool ensures that your application is restructured and optimized according to the selected framework's best practices, saving you time and effort in manual conversion. Whether you're migrating to a new framework or just exploring different options, *framework-converter* provides a seamless and efficient solution.

For the converter to work, you must have all your JS files in a scripts folder, all the CSS files in a styles folder, and all the HTML files in the root directory of the ZIP file. 
Please note that the converter is designed to work only with simple projects. Right now it only works with html, css and javascript. More languages will be added soon.

With the test-vue folder you can test the converter
